    Abstract = {The article discusses how wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments appear to be the transaction method of choice by cyber-criminals in the U.S. It says that cyber-criminals have become more brazen, more technically savvy and more sophisticated in their efforts to initiate fraudulent electronic transfers. According to the author, the rate at which the thieves are hitting the bank accounts of small business enterprises continues to rise. The benefits of using ACHs and wire transfers are also discussed.},
