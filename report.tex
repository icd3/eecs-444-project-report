\section*{Cryptographic Currency}
% Tom
Cryptographic currency seeks to solve a timeless problem in economic systems:
how can value be transferred between entities in a way that is fair for both
entities? If the trade is disputed, what value remains with which party? And,
how can value be transferred through an intangible medium?

These are problems that current monetary systems cannot handle. Paper currency
is cumbersome and most-importantly cannot be electronically transferred. The
digital representation of money used by banks is actually just a clever system
of account withdrawals and credits in an agreed-upon order by banks.

\subsection*{Transferring Money, Today}
If an entity wished to transfer money to another entity today, they have a few
choices at their disposal. Some of these options include a check, a wire
transfer, the Automated Clearing House system, or
PayPal\cite{wiki:wiretransfer}.
